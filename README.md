# candidate-compatibility
This project is a sample project to determine compatibility amongst an existing team and potential new members

# Business Process
- Resources are evaluated against an existing team by the following attributes: Intelligence, Strength, Endurance, and Spicy Food Tolerance
- The goal is to determine compatibility, which will be defined as the difference between the skill level of the candidate and against the average of the teams.
- Scores closer to 1 indicate the candidate skill level is close to or exceeds the teams average level across all attributes.
- Scores closer to 0 indicate the candidate skill level may have definciencies in 1 or more attributes. 

# Assumptions 
- Attributes are score from 0 - 10
- Scores are weighted equally accross 4 attributes (e.g., 0.25 for Intelligence, 0.25 for Strength, etc)
